Title: Win32 API Window Docking System
Description: This code consists of three files, two are a header file and source file for the window docking system and the third is a simple program that demonstrates the use of the window docking system.
The window docking system allows any number of windows to snap to and dock with a main window using purely Win32 API code, none of that nasty MFC stuff!
